# Mobile First Responsive Web Design

This is an in-class exercise. We will be learning Mobile First Responsive Web Design principles, and how to use media queries. This exercise will deal with css layout, so you will need to have completed your Treehouse assignment (CSS Basic Layout) to fully understand what we're trying to implement. 

Within this repo, you have been provided with a basic text file with the copy we'll be using, along with images that you'll need to use in this exercise.
